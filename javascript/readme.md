### Overview
In this single-player game, you need to place various shapes of map tiles with different terrain types on an 11x11 grid map. Each tile has a time value (1 or 2), and the game consists of 28 time units. At the end of the game (or during it), several checks (missions) are performed based on the current state of the grid, which will determine the final score.
