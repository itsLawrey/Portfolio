# C# Maui Game

This is a two-player local multiplayer game where the players take turns and try to commandeer their ships into the black hole on the middle of the grid. 
Each player's ships can only move in a straight line until they find an obstacle in their path.
The goal is to drive more than half of your ships into the black hole.

This is the same version as the one you can find in the `BlackHole`, `BlackHole2` folder. This program is made in Maui, meaning it can even run on your phone!

This version is a bit of a downgrade since the graphics here are not actual rockets and a black hole, just colored cells in a grid.

### Functions
- You can save, load, start a new game.
- Click to select a ship, then click again in the main four directions to make it move.

### Use

Download the files, and run `Blackhole.Maui.sln` on your system using Visual Studio.
