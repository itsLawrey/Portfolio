    Lengyel began his esports career in 2016, while also regularly streaming. Most notably, he played for the Dallas Fuel in the Overwatch League's inaugural season, before being released midway through the season due to repeated controversy and suspensions, as well as for Team Canada in the Overwatch World Cup from 2017 to 2019.

## The Juice
>xQc says "the juice" so often in his streams that it is now a recognized term in the Urban Dictionary. It defines "the juice" in the following manner.

>"Something that is fulfilling, which has The juice. xQc defines "the juice" as, "The juice is whatever you make it. It can be anything. Nobody can define what it is for you, you know what the juice is right. For me, like sometimes, I think the juice is whenever I win I Pop Off right... maybe your juice is when you do a nice piece of art."
xQc was quite motivational in his explanation of "the juice." He said the juice was pretty much anything that anyone could want it to be. For him, his 'juice' is his gaming. To someone else, it could be a piece of art they made. Therefore, it differs from person to person. Essentially, 'the juice' could be anything that is motivating an individual.
